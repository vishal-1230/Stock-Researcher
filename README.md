This is a Stock Researcher Website. I've mainly worked on frontend with JS only i.e no library or framework.
For rendering the graph, I've used Apex Graphs API, which I found very useful and easy to use.
For getting the stock data, I've used Alpha-Vantage API. I just had the free subscription of the API, so I'm restricted to 5 API calls per minute. That's why you've to wait for a minute before searching for another stock.
(Each letter typed in search box, calls the api. One call is made for getting the news & sentiments and two calls are made when you search for the stock to get price data & overview of company)

LEARNINGS:
I learnt to work with public APIs, how to fetch them, how to extract the json data, how async await works. Also learnt about get and post requests a little bit.
